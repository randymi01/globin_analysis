1. Filter for coding and non-coding, and manual filter out hemoglobin and not, and make volcano for four combos
2. Find differentially expressed genes on shared genes using the design matrix X ~ GD + Patient
	a. Make volcano plot
	b. save dds and res as RDS
3. Color code by RNA type then make bar graph for up and down regulated significant DEGs (more than 1.5 LFC, p adj < 0.05)
